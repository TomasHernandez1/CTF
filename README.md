**CTF

I'm currently learning the basics of CTFs.
I'm using the kali linux environment on a Virtual Machine via Virtual Box.

In this repository i'm keeping track of solved CTFs with their solution; the file 'CTF procedure' has the common procedures for each prompt given by the CTFs; this file will be updated every time I find a new way of solving a CTF.
